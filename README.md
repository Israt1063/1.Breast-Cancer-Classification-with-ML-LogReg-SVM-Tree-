# Breast Cancer Classifier using Machine Learning

This project implements supervised machine learning models to classify breast cancer tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The models are trained and evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* ROC-AUC

## Results Summary

| Model               | ROC-AUC Score |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| Logistic Regression | 1.00          |
| Decision Tree       | 0.94          |
| SVM                 | 1.00          |

## Notes

* This project uses supervised learning with labeled data.
* Models trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
* Perfect ROC-AUC scores might indicate overfitting; cross-validation is recommended.
